# Latent Space Estimation

## TODO:
- [ ] Train an autoencoder on just $(x, y)$. This is to see if all the other parts of my code (training loop, data generation, etc is working as expected).
- [ ] Normalize the inputs to the autoencoder and see if this has any effect on performance (how would we measure this is a question that I need to address).
- [ ] Turn this into a package so that you don't have to import the path in test files.
